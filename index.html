<h2>Some of my interests include:</h2>
        <div class="floater1 col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
            <ul>
                <li>Sports, such as Baseball, Football, and College Basketball</li>
               
            </ul>
             <p>I've played these sports throughout high school and freshman year at Luther I played baseball. Unfortunately, I tore my shoulder and wasn't able to competively play anymore...but I still play these sports as a hobby. 
        </div>
        <div class="floater2 col-xs-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
            <ul>
                <li>Being outdoors and fishing, biking, longboarding...etc</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I own a fishing boat and avidly fish on the Mississpi River in the port of Winona, MN. I used to hate fishing because of the patience, but I have now realized that it is one of my favorite hobbies. Although it is winter weather for half of the year, it is frustrating not being able to do these hobbies.<p>

        <div class="floater3 col-xs-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
            <ul>
               <li>I also enjoy being an addict of Netflix.</li>
                
            </ul>
            <p>I think this goes without saying, being that pretty much every college student has an addiction for Netflix. However, this can present a problem with my connection since everybody tends to be on Netflix when I am.
