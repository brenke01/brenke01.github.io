<h1>My Interest of Fishing</h1>
<img src="fishing.jpg" width "100" height="100"/>

<p>I have grown up fishing with my father and I have enjoyed it many time.</p>

<p>...Unless of course I end up not catching anything after hours on the boat.</p>

<h2>Here are some of the notable fish I have caught in the past couple of years: </h2>
<ol>
    <li> Tuna fish in the Pacific Ocean off of Mexico </li>
    <li> 28 inch Nothern Pike in the Mississipi River </li>
    <li> 8 lb Catfish in the Mississippi River </li>
</ol>
