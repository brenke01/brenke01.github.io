<h1>2014 Minnesota Twins Preview</h1>

<p>As yet another tough season came to a close in 2013, the Minnesota Twins are looking to their prospects for a solution </p>

<p>The Minnesota Twins have many young starters to hopefully fix the problematic pitching rotation </p>

<p>Some notable new pitchers and prospects that hope to make a name for themselves include: </p>

<ol>
   <li>Phil Hughes: RHP acquired from the New York Yankees</li>
   <li>Alex Meyer: RHP ranked in the top 100 prospects of 2014</li>
   <li>Trevor May: RHP ranked in the top 100 prosepcts of 2014</li>
</ol>

<p>Two of the biggest prospects in the last five years hope to make their way on to the roster this year. Outfielder Byron Buxton has been ranked the number 1 prospect in the entire nation. To join him is 3B Miguel Sano, a power hitter that could find himself in the Twins lineup as soon as this June.</p>
